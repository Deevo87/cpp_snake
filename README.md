It's a small project for c++ course I was taking on AGH.

  <h2>To play the game you have to:</h2>
1. Install and setup <strong>raylib</strong> library on your computer.

- I recommend using tutorials from official raylib github repository:

  > for **linux** https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux

  > for **windows** https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-Windows

  > for **macOS** https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-macOS
2. Git clone or download the repository and enjoy the game!
