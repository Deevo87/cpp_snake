It's a small project for c++ course I was taking on AGH.

  ##To play the game you have to:
1. Install and setup **raylib** library on your computer.
- I recommend using tutorials from official raylib github repository:
  > for **linux** https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux
  > for **windows** https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-Windows
  > for **macOS** https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-macOS
2. Git clone or download the repository and enjoy the game!
